# Data-Structure
A small project of DS 
Firstly, in this project Ι constructed some simple methods using linked lists and then I present a programm called Thiseas which is about a labyrinth using a backtracking algorithm.
Also, in another project Ι constructed some methods using priority queues in order to emulate a print server and fianlly, I added some files with methos I created using 2d-Trees.
